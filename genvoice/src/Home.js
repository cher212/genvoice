						Hello! I'm Cheryl, a Year 3 Information Systems major at
						the National University of Singapore. <br />
						<br />
						My passion lies in challenging myself to build
						innovative solutions that make a difference in both
						digital and physical spaces. With hands-on experience in
						technologies such as React, Next.js, Firebase, SQL,
						HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Jakarta EE, I enjoy
						creating user-friendly interfaces and impactful digital
						products. I believe that technology should not only
						solve problems but also enhance user experiences. This
						drive motivates me to continually learn and experiment
						with new ideas, whether itâ€™s through school projects or
						personal initiatives. I'm particularly enthusiastic
						about front-end development, where I can blend my
						creativity with technical skills to design intuitive
						applications. <br />
						<br />
						In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging in
						team sports like Netball and Tchoukball. The camaraderie
						and teamwork that come with these activities fuel my
						collaborative spirit, making me a better team player in
						both sports and tech.
						<br />
						<br />
						I'm always eager for opportunities to gain more
						experience, learn from others, and contribute to
						projects that positively impact users.
